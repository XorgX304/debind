Debind
------------

Debind is a tool to efficently tunnel, through a secure transport layer, every
UDP DNS query your Linux machine makes. It redirect every UDP DNS queries
(system wide) to debind, forge them into DNS TCP queries and forward them to a
secure tunnel using SSH or other possible secure TCP tunnel you can come up
with.

Other very cool features come with it. Please use it, play with it and feel
free to communicate with the authors for any questions/comments/contributions/
and beers to offer :).

REQUIREMENTS:

	- iptables
	Needed for DNAT option and NFQUEUE option.

	- libnetfilter_queue >= 1.0.0
	It is a userspace library providing an API to packets that have been queued
	by the kernel packet filter.

	http://www.netfilter.org/projects/libnetfilter_queue/index.html

	Requires NFQUEUE option from the Netfilter project in your kernel.

	- libssh2 >= 1.30
	It is a client-side C library implementing the SSH2 protocol.

	- libpopt
	Library for parsing command line parameters

	* Debian/Ubuntu package: libpopt-dev

USAGE:

Basic use case:

In order to redirect *all* UDP DNS traffic, which is basically all DNS traffic of
a standard Linux box, do the following:

$ sudo ./debind --ssh USER@HOST[:PORT] --dnat

--ssh : Will create the SSH tunnel using libssh2.

--dnat: Will use iptables to DNAT every DNS request to the local port which is 1337.

Note that you can use your own SSH tunnel created with the ssh client like so:

$ ssh -L 1337:<forward-dns-ip>:53 ...

and run debind:

$ sudo ./debind --dnat -p 1337

Other options are available. Use --help for a complete listing.
